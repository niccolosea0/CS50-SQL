-- You need to make a recommendation about which players the team should consider hiring. With the team’s dwindling budget,
-- the general manager wants to know which players were paid the lowest salaries in 2001.
-- In 4.sql, write a SQL query to find the 50 players paid the least in 2001.

-- Sort players by salary, lowest to highest.
-- If two players have the same salary, sort alphabetically by first name and then by last name.
-- If two players have the same first and last name, sort by player ID.
-- Your query should return three columns, one for players’ first names, one for their last names, and one for their salaries.
